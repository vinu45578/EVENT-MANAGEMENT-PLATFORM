## Problem Statement

In many colleges and universities, event participation and volunteering activities are managed using informal tools such as Google Forms, WhatsApp groups, emails, and notice boards. While these methods are easy to use, they often result in poor communication and limited event visibility. Students may miss important announcements because information is scattered across multiple platforms, leading to reduced participation and missed volunteering opportunities.

Additionally, volunteer management becomes inefficient due to the lack of proper tracking systems. Students may register as volunteers but fail to attend events, creating last-minute challenges for organizers. Since there is no centralized system to manage registrations, confirmations, and attendance, event execution often suffers from poor coordination and low accountability.
