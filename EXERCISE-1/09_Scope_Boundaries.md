## Scope Boundaries

Scope boundaries define the limits of the **Event Management Platform** by clearly identifying what the system will and will not do.

### Included Boundaries

- The system will allow administrators to create, update, and manage events.
- Students can view upcoming events and register for participation.
- The system supports volunteer enrollment for events.
- Attendance of participants and volunteers can be tracked.
- Event details such as date, time, venue, and description will be displayed.
- The system maintains student participation and volunteering records.
- Basic reports related to event participation and attendance will be available.

### Excluded Boundaries

- The system will not support mobile application–specific features.
- The system will not include online payment or ticketing functionality.
- The system will not integrate with external third-party event platforms.
- The system will not provide AI-based analytics or predictions.
- The system will not support multi-institution or cross-college event management.

Defining these boundaries helps prevent scope creep and ensures the project remains focused, achievable, and aligned with the defined objectives.
