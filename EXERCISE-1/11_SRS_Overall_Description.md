## SRS – Overall Description

### Product Perspective
The **Event Management Platform** is a standalone, web-based application designed to replace fragmented and manual methods of managing college events such as Google Forms, WhatsApp groups, emails, and notice boards. The system operates independently and provides a centralized interface for event creation, registration, volunteering, and attendance tracking without relying on external event management systems.

### Product Functions
The main functions of the Event Management Platform include:

- Creating, updating, and managing events by administrators
- Displaying upcoming and ongoing events to students
- Allowing students to register for events
- Enabling volunteer enrollment with defined roles
- Tracking attendance of participants and volunteers
- Sending event-related notifications and updates
- Maintaining participation and volunteering history for students
- Generating basic reports for event participation and attendance

### User Classes and Characteristics

- **Students**  
  Have basic computer and internet knowledge; primarily use the system to view events, register, volunteer, and track participation records.

- **Event Organizers / Administrators**  
  Possess moderate technical skills; responsible for creating events, managing registrations, coordinating volunteers, and tracking attendance.

- **Faculty Coordinators**  
  Use the system to oversee events, monitor student participation, and verify records for recognition or certification.

### Operating Environment

- Web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox
- Desktop or laptop systems
- Internet connection for accessing the web application

### Design and Implementation Constraints

- Limited development time for the project
- Use of open-source tools and frameworks
- Web-based interface only (no mobile application in the current phase)
- Limited scalability due to academic project constraints

### Assumptions and Dependencies

- Users have basic knowledge of using web applications
- The system will be accessed through modern web browsers
- Internet connectivity is available during usage
- Data storage and system features are limited to the scope defined for the current project phase
