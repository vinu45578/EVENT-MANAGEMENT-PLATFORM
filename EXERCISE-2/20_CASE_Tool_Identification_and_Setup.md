## CASE Tool Identification and Setup

CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools are used to support software design, documentation, and project management activities.

### Selected CASE Tools
The following CASE tools were selected for designing the **Event Management Platform**:

- **draw.io** – for creating UML diagrams  
- **GitHub** – for version control and documentation management  

### Purpose of Tool Selection

- **draw.io** was chosen because it is easy to use, web-based, and supports standard UML diagrams such as use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams. It allows quick creation and modification of diagrams without requiring local installation.
- **GitHub** was selected to maintain project source code and documentation, enable team collaboration, track changes, and manage project progress efficiently.

### Setup Details

- **draw.io** was accessed directly through a web browser without any installation.
- A **GitHub repository** was created to store all project-related documents, diagrams, and implementation files.

These CASE tools supported effective design, documentation, collaboration, and management of the **Event Management Platform** throughout the project lifecycle.
