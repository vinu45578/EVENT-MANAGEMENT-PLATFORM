## Team Workspace Setup

A team workspace was established to enable effective collaboration during the development of the **Event Management Platform**.

### Workspace Platform
**GitHub** was used as the primary team workspace for collaboration and project management.

### Workspace Features
- Centralized repository for storing all project documents, diagrams, and source code  
- Version control to track changes made by team members  
- Collaboration support through shared access, commits, and history tracking  

### Team Collaboration
All team members were added to the GitHub repository and assigned appropriate roles. Regular communication was maintained through online messaging and discussions to coordinate tasks, review progress, and resolve issues.

### Benefits
The team workspace ensured transparency, proper documentation, version control, and efficient collaboration throughout the project lifecycle of the **Event Management Platform**.
