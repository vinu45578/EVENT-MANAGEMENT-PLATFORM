## Project Structure Definition

The project structure defines how files and folders are organized for the **Event Management Platform** to ensure clarity, consistency, and maintainability.

### Repository Structure
The project repository is organized into the following main folders:

#### Exercise-1_SRS
Contains all **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** documents such as the problem statement, scope definition, functional and non-functional requirements, stakeholder analysis, use case descriptions, and glossary.

#### Exercise-2_Design
Contains system design documents including **UML diagrams**, use case diagrams, and other CASE tool–related design artifacts.

### Benefits of the Structure
- Easy navigation through project files  
- Clear separation between requirements and design documents  
- Better organization for academic evaluation and future reference  

This structured approach helps maintain consistency, improves project understanding, and supports smooth progression across different phases of the **Event Management Platform** development.
