- View upcoming and ongoing events  
- Register for events  
- Enroll as volunteers  
- View participation and volunteering history  

### 2. Event Organizer / Administrator
The event organizer or administrator is responsible for:
- Creating and managing events  
- Updating event details  
- Managing event registrations  
- Tracking attendance of participants and volunteers  
- Coordinating event execution  

### 3. System Administrator
The system administrator is responsible for:
- Maintaining the system  
- Managing user access and roles  
- Ensuring data availability and reliability

Identifying these actors helps clearly define system interactions and responsibilities during the design and development phases of the **Event Management Platform**.
