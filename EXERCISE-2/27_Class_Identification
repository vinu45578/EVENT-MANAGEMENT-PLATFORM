## Class Identification

Class identification helps in identifying the main classes required to design the **Event Management Platform**.

### Identified Classes

### 1. User
Represents a user of the system.  
Users can have different roles such as Student, Event Organizer, or Administrator.

### 2. Event
Represents an event created within the system.  
Stores details such as event name, date, time, venue, and description.

### 3. Registration
Represents the registration details of a student for an event.  
Links users with events and stores registration status.

### 4. Volunteer
Represents volunteer enrollment details for events.  
Includes volunteer role, assigned duties, and event association.

### 5. Attendance
Represents attendance records of participants and volunteers for events.

### 6. Notification
Represents system-generated messages related to event updates, registrations, or changes.

### 7. Dashboard
Represents the main interface where users can view events, registrations, attendance status, and participation history.

Identifying these classes helps in structuring the system architecture and supports effective object-oriented design for the **Event Management Platform** during the design phase.
