## Sequence Diagram Explanation

The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the **Student**, the **Event Management Platform**, and the **Database** during an event-related operation (such as event registration or volunteer enrollment).

### Explanation

1. The student initiates an action by selecting an event and submitting a request (registration or volunteer enrollment).
2. The Event Management Platform receives the request from the student.
3. The system processes the request and sends the relevant data to the database for storage.
4. The database stores the registration or volunteer details and sends a confirmation back to the system.
5. The system confirms the successful action and displays a success message to the student.

This sequence diagram helps in understanding the step-by-step flow of interactions and data exchange between the user, system, and database during event participation in the **Event Management Platform**.
