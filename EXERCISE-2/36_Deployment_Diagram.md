## Deployment Diagram

The deployment diagram represents the physical deployment of the **Event Management Platform** and how system components are distributed across different environments.

### Deployment Structure

#### User Device
- Students and administrators access the system using a web browser.
- Devices may include desktops or laptops with an active internet connection.

#### Web Server
- Hosts the Event Management Platform web application.
- Handles user requests such as event viewing, registration, volunteer enrollment, and event management.
- Processes business logic and communicates with the database server.

#### Database Server
- Stores system data including user details, event information, registrations, volunteer records, attendance data, and participation history.

### Deployment Flow

- The user interacts with the Event Management Platform through a web browser on their device.
- The browser sends requests to the web server hosting the application.
- The web server processes the requests and communicates with the database server to store or retrieve required data.
- The processed information is sent back to the user through the web interface.

This deployment diagram helps in understanding how the **Event Management Platform** components are physically deployed and interact within a real-world environment.
