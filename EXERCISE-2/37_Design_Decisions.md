## Design Decisions

The following design decisions were made during the development of the **Event Management Platform**:

- A **web-based architecture** was chosen to ensure easy access for students and administrators from any location using a web browser.
- A **simple and user-friendly interface** was prioritized to encourage higher participation and reduce the learning curve for first-time users.
- A **modular design approach** was adopted to clearly separate the user interface, application logic, and data storage layers.
- **UML diagrams** were used extensively to represent system structure, behavior, and interactions in a clear and standardized manner.
- **Open-source tools and technologies** were selected to minimize cost, ensure flexibility, and support academic project requirements.

These design decisions helped ensure that the **Event Management Platform** is scalable, maintainable, and easy to use, while also aligning with best software engineering practices.
