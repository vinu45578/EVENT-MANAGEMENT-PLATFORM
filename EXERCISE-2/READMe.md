# Event Management Platform

## Project Overview
The **Event Management Platform** is a web-based application designed to centralize and streamline the management of college events and volunteering activities. The system enables administrators to create and manage events, while students can easily view events, register, volunteer, and track their participation history. This improves communication, coordination, and accountability within the institution.

This project is developed as part of the **Software Engineering and Agile Development (SEAD)** course.

## Project Objectives
- To provide a centralized and user-friendly platform for managing college events  
- To improve visibility of events and volunteering opportunities for students  
- To apply software engineering concepts such as SRS and UML-based design  
- To document requirements and system design using CASE tools  
- To manage project work collaboratively using GitHub  

## Features
