# EVENT-MANAGEMENT-PLATFORM
A centralized platform for managing college events and volunteering activities. It allows administrators to create and manage events, while students can easily view events, register, and volunteer. The system improves communication, tracks attendance, and maintains participation records for recognition and certificates.
